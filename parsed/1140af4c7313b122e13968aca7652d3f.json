While LLMs have demonstrated remarkable ability in achieving high-quality annotation in various tasks,\n                                     the key to applying this ability to specific tasks lies in developing high-quality prompts. Thus we propose a framework to\n                                        inherit the merits of both zero-shot learning and few-shot learning by incorporating enriched instructions derived from\n                                      input-output demonstrations to optimize original prompt. We refer to the enrichment as the Hint and propose a framework to\n                                      automatically generate the hint from labeled data. More concretely, starting from an initial prompt, our method first instructs\n                                    a LLM to deduce new hints for selected samples from incorrect predictions, and then summarizes from per-sample hints and\n                                  adds the results back to the initial prompt to form a new, enriched instruction. The proposed method is evaluated on the\n                                 BIG-Bench Instruction Induction dataset for both zero-shot and few-shot prompts, where experiments demonstrate that our\n                               method is able to significantly boost accuracy for multiple tasks.2023                  Keywords\n                                       large language models, automatic prompt optimization, natural language processing, natural language generation\nAug           1.
