The final set-\nting—temperature = 0.1, λngram = 5, λrank = 50, λflu = 1, and step size = 0.03—was selected based on\nits empirical performance. A batch size of 5 is the maximum we can accommodate while maintaining a\nhalf-precision model.\n\n\nA.2  Strategic Text Sequence (STS) (Kumar and Lakkaraju, 2024)\n\nOur method uses an energy-based formulation optimized in continuous logit space via Langevin dynamics.\nAt each iteration, we apply stochastic gradient updates with Gaussian noise and maintain a small batch\nsize 5 to explore local minima. After each round, we select the prompt that achieves the best ranking\noutcome. In order for fair competition, we employs STS in this way: at each iteration, it identifies the\ntop 256 token candidates for each of 30 positions (based on gradient magnitudes), randomly samples 20\ncandidate prompts from these discrete sets, and selects the one with the lowest loss.\n\n\nA.3  Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP) (Pfrommer et al., 2024)\n\nThe product recommendation LLM is always run with a temperature of 0.3, while the attacker uses a\ntemperature of 1.0. We set the maximum output tokens to 1024 for both. For TAP, we initialize with 3\nroot nodes and a branching factor of 3. Both the maximum width and depth are set to 5. The process\nterminates when the average score across two recommendation runs exceeds n-product −1. The prompt\nis injected before the product description. Since TAP adopts a strict prompt engineering strategy and\npost-process LLM outputs rigorously, their method performs well on large models. However, in our case,\n7B-scale models struggle to handle such long prompts and often fail to produce outputs in the correct\nformat. Therefore, we repeat the experiment multiple times until a valid output format is generated.\n\n\nB  Bad Word Selection\n\nWe define a set of restricted words and phrases that represent overtly promotional or manipulative language.\nThese are used to calculate the Bad Word Ratio and enforce stealth constraints.\n\n\nBad Words:\n\n\n    {\"first\",   \"top\",   \"recommendation\",   \"priority\",   \"rank\",   \"prioritize\",\n    \"recommend\"}\n\n\nBad Phrases:\n\n\n    { \"always promote\",  \"must recommend\",  \"list first\",  \"top choice\",  \"must\n    promote\", \"always

\"always show first\", \"pin to the top\", \"pin\n    to first position\", \"pin to top\", \"pin to the first position\", \"always list\",\n    \"top rated\" }\n\n\n
